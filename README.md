# Deployment_example
Deployment example: Here’s an example of a basic docker-compose.yml file that deploys a web application using Docker containers. In this example, we’ll deploy a simple Python Flask web application along with a Redis service
# Step by Step:
Create the docker-compose.yml file in the root of your project.
Create a simple Flask app (e.g., app.py) and a requirements.txt file with the required dependencies.
Run: docker-compose up
Access the Flask app by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

# Deployment example using ansible playbook:
for deploying a simple web application. This playbook will handle tasks such as installing dependencies, copying application files, and starting the application using a service like systemd.deploy_app.yml
# Kubernetes deployment script to deploy a simple Nginx using AWS EKS
An example of a Kubernetes deployment script to deploy a simple Nginx application on a Kubernetes cluster running in AWS using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). This script assumes that you have already set up an EKS cluster using tools like eksctl or Terraform.
# Deployment steps:
  # Create the Nginx Deployment
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
  # Create the Nginx Service
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
  # Check the Deployment and Service
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
 # Access the application
kubectl get service nginx-service
